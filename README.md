# Nonlinear Kirchhoff plate model

This is a C++ implementation in [FEniCS](www.fenicsproject.org) of the
nonlinear Kirchhoff model using a non-conforming implementation with
Discrete Kirchhoff Triangles as described in [1].



## To do

1. Parallel operation across all classes. Check `IsometryConstraint`,
   `KirchhoffAssembler` and `DKTGradient` in particular.
2. Stopping condition: $||\nabla \theta (d_t y^{n+1}_h) || < \epsilon $
3. Implement a check on the validity of the boundary conditions for
   the initial deformation of the gradient flow.

Remember to check `DiscreteOperators.h` in the dolfin sources for some
ideas.

## Dependencies

These are bundled in the docker image which I haven't pushed to
dockerhub yet because it needs cleaning and fine tuning. Basically it
amounts to:

* The base fenics-dev image.
* My implementations of Hermite and DKT elements for FIAT and FFC.
